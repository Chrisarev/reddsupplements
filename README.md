Description 
-----------------------------------

Technology
------------------------------------
Front-end created using React + Vite. Back-end created with Express. Database utilized is MongoDB. User authentication is done with passport.js. 

Running/Deploying
------------------------------------
All unoptimized react files are in client folder. Production ready, built version of these files are in the parent public folder. To run this project locally you can 'nodemon app.js' in root folder to start the express backend, then go to /client/src and 'npm run dev' to start the react front-end. Client folder is unnecessary for production environment and should be deleted before deployment of this application.
